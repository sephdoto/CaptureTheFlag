# Editing this README

When you're ready to make this README your own, just edit this file and use the handy template below (or feel free to structure it however you want - this is just a starting point!). Thanks to [makeareadme.com](https://www.makeareadme.com/) for this template.

## Suggestions for a good README

Every project is different, so consider which of these sections apply to yours. The sections used in the template are suggestions for most open source projects. Also keep in mind that while a README can be too long and detailed, too long is better than too short. If you think your README is too long, consider utilizing another form of documentation rather than cutting out information.

## Name
Capture the Flag Project Team 14


## Description
We are to build a Game Client and Game Engine which implements a made up game called Capture the Flag. The rules are set in the [parent project](https://swt-praktikum.informatik.uni-mannheim.de/kessel/cfp-service) from our professor. 


## Badges
On some READMEs, you may see small images that convey metadata, such as whether or not all the tests are passing for the project. You can use Shields to add some to your README. Many services also have instructions for adding a badge.

## Visuals
Depending on what you are making, it can be a good idea to include screenshots or even a video (you'll frequently see GIFs rather than actual videos). Tools like ttygif can help, but check out Asciinema for a more sophisticated method.

## Installation
The Client System does not have a UI yet which is connected to it. So its still under development. However the Game Engine and Client layer for the project are nearly done with most of the requirments about to be finished

## Usage
Use examples liberally, and show the expected output if you can. It's helpful to have inline the smallest example of usage that you can demonstrate, while providing links to more sophisticated examples if they are too long to reasonably include in the README.

## Support
Discord or Whatsapp is what we are using to stay in touch.

## Roadmap
- Finalize the Game Engine. We are 90% done with it.
- Develop the UI
- Integrate the UI with the client

## Authors 
Participants:
- Raffay Syed
- Simon Stumpf
- Manuel Krakowski
- Yannick Siebenhaar
- Aaron Niemesch

## License
Its more or less open source

## Project status
Under development. Expected completion ..By end of April
