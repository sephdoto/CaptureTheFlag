## Name
Capture the Flag Project Team 14


## Description
We are to build a Game Client and Game Engine which implements a made up game called Capture the Flag. The rules are set in the [parent project](https://swt-praktikum.informatik.uni-mannheim.de/kessel/cfp-service) from our professor. 

## Visuals
Depending on what you are making, it can be a good idea to include screenshots or even a video (you'll frequently see GIFs rather than actual videos). Tools like ttygif can help, but check out Asciinema for a more sophisticated method.

## Installation
The software runs through a JAR file which is called CTF-UI.jar. We will make it available in the root directory of our project

## Support
Discord or Whatsapp is what we are using to stay in touch.
